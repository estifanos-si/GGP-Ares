# Implementation Stages

## Goal 

   To be able to play:
    1. strategically 
    2. correctly. (without memory running out or crashing or making a mistake.)

## Tasks

    1. Montecarlo.
    2. Visualization.
    3. Memomory leaks in the reasoner.
    4. organizing unit tests.
    5. Remove the callbacks. Make it sequential.

### MonteCarlo 

    Basic Idea.
    Implementation issues.
